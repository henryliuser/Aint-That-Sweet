A red rose, like the red rosy petals of an umbrella, is a symbol of love and affection.

"It's an ancient Greek symbol of a love that burns bright for both sexes in a very loving way," said Dr. Robert Briffault, CEO of the SAGE Foundation. "It can be interpreted by men as a sexual signal of desire, by women as a symbol of confidence."

The rose has a long history in literature and plays and is a traditional flower that appears in other media, like the Twilight series.
