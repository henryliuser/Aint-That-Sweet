My sweet baby

Carry on the good work! 

A good thing, 

You've changed this world 

Oh, you know the old saying, 'There's nothing new in life,' 

They just say things like that like it's something new. Well I don't believe 

in lies, even if you give me a bad name. And I don't let you have your way.
