Of many reasons I love you here is one 

the way you write me from the gate at the airport 
so I can tell you everything will be alright 

so you can tell me there is a bird 
trapped in the terminal all the people 
ignoring it because they do not know 
what to do with it except to leave it alone 
until it scares itself to death
